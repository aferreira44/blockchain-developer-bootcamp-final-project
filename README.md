## Smart Contract Creation Workflow

1. Users will have to choose the type of smart contract they wants to create.

2. Users will have to fill in the form with the smart contracts parameters.

3. They'll have to submit the smart contract to create it.

4. They'll have to pay to create the smart contract (mining fee + service fee)
